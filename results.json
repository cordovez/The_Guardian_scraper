{"article_title": "Rishi Sunak’s White House jolly can’t mask the fact that Brexit Britain is a fading power ", "author": "Rafael Behr", "summary": "The prime minister arrives in Washington with no real leverage in Europe – and therefore no real leverage with Joe Biden", "date_of_pub": "Wed 7 Jun 2023", "content": "The Americans know how to make a prime minister feel special. It isn’t hard. Saying “you are special” or words to that effect, usually does the trick. It helps to say it in the White House, within earshot of the British press corps.Westminster hacks and Downing Street aides, most of whom are unhealthily obsessed with US politics, love a Washington summit for the same reason that Harry Potter fans queue to visit the Warner Bros studio in Watford. Standing on the stage where the magic happens is its own reward.That makes Rishi Sunak a cheap date for Joe Biden at this week’s summit. The US president can bestow the normal diplomatic courtesies, while conceding nothing of strategic substance. Downing Street then tells friendly journalists that the two men bonded over baseball, or some other shared cultural enthusiasm, or that their wives did. The prime minister flies home with burnished credentials as the leader of a very important country indeed.The bar for summit success has been set low. It helps that the prime minister isn’t Boris Johnson or Liz Truss, whose bellicose Brexit methods sabotaged transatlantic relations. By negotiating the Windsor framework, easing frictions around Northern Ireland, Sunak atoned for the offence that Biden summarised crudely, but fairly, as “screwing around” with the Good Friday agreement.Sunak’s mission to Washington is also mercifully free of unrealistic speculation about a US-UK free-trade deal. This was an obsession for Brexit enthusiasts. Opening new vistas of transatlantic commerce was meant to outweigh any downside to withdrawal from the European single market.The economics of that proposition never added up, but it was a comfort to Eurosceptics, whose paranoia about London’s submission to Brussels fed a delusion of parity with Washington.Donald Trump nurtured that fantasy. His successor has kiboshed it. Biden’s economic strategy is based around lavish government support for domestic industries, tax breaks for investment and supply chains rerouted to assert US strategic primacy. That buries the model of globalisation that Brexit ideologues had in mind when mapping their buccaneering adventures on the high seas of international trade.Sunak is a disciple of the small-state, anti-intervention school of conservatism. He finds Bidenomics perplexing for that reason alone. But it also highlights the terrible error of quitting the continental bloc in which Britain, by pooling resources with European partners, had a chance of keeping pace with the Americans.If economic competition in the years ahead is going to be an arms race of industrial subsidy, the UK will be outgunned by Brussels and Washington.The counterclaim by keepers of the Brexit faith is that Britain’s isolation is really an advantage, permitting agility and innovation where Europe is staid and sclerotic. A nimbly sovereign nation might lead the way in new sectors.Hence Downing Street has hyped Sunak’s interest in AI ahead of the Washington trip. The prime minister has been consulting tech bosses about awesome new computing powers coming on stream. He has been pondering how best to manage the development of machines that might, within years, rival nuclear weapons in their capacity to cause harm in the wrong hands. He has concluded that Britain can lead the world in this field, and that London should be the capital of global AI governance. He will raise all of this with President Biden, we are told.The idea of an international AI regulator – equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna – is perfectly sensible. London could make a respectable bid to host it. But so could other cities. Either way, it won’t be decided over coffee on Wednesday night.Visiting leaders “raise” all sorts of things with their hosts. It is a diplomatic euphemism for questions brought to the table with no expectation of answers. Things are “raised” for the benefit of an audience back home, so the leader who doesn’t really set the agenda can claim to have put some item on it.Under a friendly (or credulous) media lens, the prime minister is thus projected from the margins of international influence into the centre. Something similar happened last week, when Sunak attended a summit of the European Political Community (EPC) in Moldova.The EPC was first convened last year by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is envisaged as a forum where EU and non-EU heads of government can discuss pan-continental issues. That is no substitute for the seat (and the veto) that Britain used to have at European Council summits, but it is better than nothing.Ukraine was the focus of discussions in Moldova. Except, that is, when Sunak raised the topic of illegal migration. His unilateral digression was then spun by Downing Street as Britain “taking the lead” on a vital issue; putting it “at the top of the international agenda”.This fiction was transmitted by various UK media outlets, as if all of Europe’s leaders huddled round their British counterpart while he laid down the law on small boats crossing the Channel. Preposterously, GB News even reported it as a “migration meeting”.At least Sunak was invited to Moldova. There had been no British representation the previous week at a meeting in Sweden of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. This, too, is a relatively new institution. It was launched in June 2021 by Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, to coordinate policy on “global trade and technology” between Washington and Brussels.The most recent gathering discussed a code of conduct for AI development. That is exactly the conversation Sunak thinks should be happening in London. But if Americans and Europeans are already having it somewhere else, why should they move it? What does Britain offer for just a seat in the room?To raise the question is not to deny that a UK prime minister has clout. There is heft in the office of the leader of a G7 economy, with a nuclear arsenal and a permanent seat on the UN security council. Biden makes time for Sunak because the relationship between the two countries is important. When it comes to defence and security cooperation, it is one of the sturdiest alliances in the world.But friendship is not the same as influence. It is a bald strategic fact that Brexit makes a British prime minister less useful to Washington. Without leverage in Brussels, Sunak is not in a position to broker deals with Biden. Instead, he pays tribute. That can be spun into something special for the parochial Westminster audience that doesn’t want to admit that Britain is smaller outside the EU. The message will get through eventually. There are only so many angles for making the margins look like the centre. There is only so long Britain can fake being a global power if it isn’t a player in Europe.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/rishi-sunak-white-house-summit-brexit-britain-washington-europe-joe-biden"},
{"article_title": "And a big welcome back to Holly! But lose the sanctimony – it’s not OK with the British public ", "author": "Marina Hyde", "summary": "It was a heroic attempt to save the brand by throwing Phil under a bus, but it’ll take more than crystals to shift those negative forces", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "By now you may be all over Holly Willoughby’s Hollier-than-thou return to This Morning, given that Guardian readers sent coverage of the event straight up yesterday’s most-read chart. So you’ll no doubt already know that this was the first edition of the ITV daytime show that Holly has fronted since the defenestration of her former friend and co-host Phillip Schofield for having an affair with a much younger staff member.You hear a lot about entities that would survive a nuclear apocalypse – cockroaches, scorpions, that sort of thing. On the day of a potentially catastrophic strike on Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam, please add the indomitable This Morning saga to their number.Back to daytime Elsinore, then. It’s notable that absolutely everyone involved in this story has behaved like a complete child, with the sole exception of the poor young runner whose TV career seems to have been unfairly torpedoed by it all. Unlike your Phillips and your Hollys and your Eamonns and your Martins, only he has maintained a dignified and presumably deeply miserable silence, even as those big names many years his senior have gnashed their teeth and attempted to settle all their self-indulgent little scores in public. After this level of five-act carnage, everyone else should be cleared out and the runner himself should be given the This Morning throne. He should be the Fortinbras.But we mustn’t run ahead of ourselves. Yesterday’s This Morning drama-fest began well before the show aired, as programme editor Martin Frizell was asked outside his home if there was a “toxic” working environment on the show. “I’ll tell you what’s toxic and I’ve always found it toxic,” replied Martin with an unsettling intensity. “Aubergine. Do you like aubergine? Do you? Do you like aubergine because I don’t like aubergine. It’s just a personal thing.”Oh dear. I’m afraid the suspicion must be that Martin regards himself as a gifted absurdist. Alas, coupled with his lank grey hair, this kind of deranged public address surely conjures weirder associations. In fact, only the lack of a warder handcuffed to Mr Frizell convinced me I was watching a daytime telly editor getting in a cab to work, and not an individual being taken from HMP Full Sutton to answer nine further charges.Anyway, it was then on to the show proper, which began – hilariously – with Holly staring down the camera and asking the viewers: “Are you OK?” A question to which the only rational reply would be: lol r u?!?! Good of Holly to assume viewers were feeling “shaken, troubled, let down, and worried”, and not simply mildly enjoying the implosive drama of a show they occasionally flick on as background if home in the morning.What followed in this opening monologue saw her mention the word “Phil” only once, with Willoughby thereafter fitting her erstwhile bezzie with an unrequested “they” pronoun. Let’s see it in action. “You, me and all of us at This Morning gave our love and support to someone who was not telling the truth. Who acted in a way that they themselves felt that they had to resign from ITV and step down from a career that they loved. That is a lot to process.”Such a lot. Such a lotty lot. Indeed, the attempt to force it through the processor takes me to Holly’s lifestyle brand, an online portal by the name of Wylde Moon, where Holly seems as comfortable selling you a ceramic fragrance diffuser as she is explaining some weapons-grade cobblers about numerology. But here, perhaps, enlightenment as to the events of the past few weeks is suddenly at hand.I note from Holly’s guide to crystals that malachite “uses vibrational force to sift out and shift any negative elements from the life you’ve been so brilliantly carving out for yourself”. Apologies for getting into complex geological science here, but is it possible the malachite’s sifting and shifting capabilities have in this case somehow rebounded on its wielder? How else to explain the fact Holly is now encased in a complex crystalline structure of negative associations, with a whole host of viewers promptly sweeping on to social media to brand her patronising, self-interested and disloyal?Incredible, really, that a story of This Morning’s magnitude has not been accompanied by daily polling indicating precisely where the public is at with it all. That said, do we actually need meticulously weighted canvassing to tell us how the British public feels about sanctimony? In an age where even civilians are more than familiar with the celeb-marketing language of image and personal brands, there is something reflexively old-fashioned that a lot of people’s final verdict on this entire saga will probably be that Holly has been a poor friend to someone who may or may not deserve to be at their lowest point, but who has lost their entire career and could probably benefit from a text message. Ironically, someone who appears to have acted solely to avoid tarnishing her own brand has – by those very actions – seen it oxidise much faster than it would have otherwise.That said, I can only congratulate Holly’s agent on the now seemingly diurnal reports that the BBC is about to “swoop” for the “daytime telly queen”. The last time reports like this emerged with such regularity , Holly was in the middle of the bizarre so-called crisis precipitated by her and Phil attending the late Queen’s lying in state via the journalists’ entrance. Are these truly the moments the BBC thinks: “let’s poach her”? No doubt time will show.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/this-morning-holly-willoughby-phillip-schofield-sanctimony-crystals"},
{"article_title": "So this is British justice: Boris Johnson gets legal aid and a mother of three on the breadline doesn’t", "author": "Owen Jones", "summary": "Our universal right to legal representation has been cut to shreds by Tory austerity – and women are the worst affected", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "Boris Johnson is a very rich man, even though he suffers from a self-pitying syndrome that afflicts many of the well-off: believing himself to be poorer than he actually is. Although he once described his £250,000-a-year newspaper column salary as “chicken feed”, and reportedly complained that his prime ministerial annual pay packet of more than £150,000 wasn’t enough to live on, he was already in the top 1% of earners when he lived in No 10.And he has only prospered since, having moved into a £3.8m Oxfordshire mansion –with nine bedrooms and a moat on three sides – and earned well over £5 million since resigning from the prime ministerial office in disgrace.Yet this enormously wealthy man, who as prime minister presided over the illegality that saw government officials partying while ordinary citizens could not hold the hand of a dying relative – while also being fined himself for violating the rules – somehow benefits from a taxpayer-funded legal defence in the Partygate inquiry, already to the tune of a quarter of a million pounds.Now consider the difference between Boris Johnson and a woman I spoke with recently, who, for the sake of her anonymity, I’ll call Sally. Sally is a single mother of three children who was paid a modest salary as a health professional. Although she can only give limited details, she was dragged through the court by an abusive, controlling former partner. She has spent about £40,000 on legal fees, was driven into so much debt that she had to sell her house and was forced to use food banks to feed her children.But here’s the kicker. “I wasn’t entitled to legal aid as I had too much equity in my family home,” she tells me. So there she is, on universal credit, languishing on the breadline, having been taken to court multiple times and left too ill to work by the trauma of it all. “Boris Johnson and his millionaire friends have their legal bills paid when they are rich … it’s another injustice in an already unjust, broken system,” she said.“In England, justice is open to all – like the Ritz Hotel!” quipped the Irish judge James Mathew in the 19th century. It was a succinct takedown of the perversities of class-bound societies, where supposedly universal rights in fact depend on your bank balance. It’s tempting to mourn how little has changed since then but, actually, things did change, if only temporarily. The postwar Labour government first introduced legal aid as one of the central pillars of a new welfare state in 1949, allowing eight out of 10 Britons to access free or affordable legal assistance.But a tragic historical lesson that needs to be learned over and over again is that, however permanent victories may seem, unless they are continually fought for, they can and will be reversed. Even before the Tories assumed power in 2010, only 27% had acccess to legal aid, and from 2013, David Cameron’s administration lopped off £751m from the £2.2bn legal aid fund.The primary victims? Women, low earners and those from minority backgrounds. On the eve of Tory rule, there were about a million legal aid cases to get early advice; that number has now dropped to 130,000, and ordinary citizens are unable to get support for problems ranging from family to housing to debt. In the half a decade after the Tory onslaught against legal aid, half of all law centres and not-for-profit legal advice services in England and Wales vanished.Ours is a country where a rich, powerful man like Johnson receives state support for his legal problems, despite his obvious wrongdoing in office. After all, he didn’t resign for nothing. But often traumatised women are left with nothing. Another women I spoke with, Sarah – again, not her name – said that, even though her former partner was was violent and her children fear him, working 16 hours a week took her over the threshold for legal aid. “No legal aid for us common people who aren’t former prime ministers,” is her caustic summary. She’s right to be furious. As our disgraced former ruler milks the state, despite being awash with millions, think of the struggling people his party has condemned to misery and hardship.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/british-justice-boris-johnson-legal-aid-mother-breadline-austerity"},

{"article_title": null, "author": null, "summary": "A long-anticipated campaign seems to have begun. Kyiv desperately needs good news – but even that would come at a high price", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "The current fog of war in Ukraine is in large part artificially generated: “Plans love silence,” Kyiv observed in a typically well-executed video released on social media on Sunday, showing its soldiers holding fingers to their lips. After months of speculation, and amid perceptible impatience in some foreign capitals, its long-awaited counteroffensive appears at last to be in its preliminary stages.The deputy defence minister has acknowledged that “offensive actions” have begun in some areas. They appear to be testing and – perhaps – creating Russian vulnerabilities, presumably with a view to determining where to commit key troops along the 600-mile frontline. Russia has created multiple layers of defences; US sources have suggested that those could prove less formidable than they appear.The urgency of this offensive may be felt most strongly by those living under Russian occupation. Momentum is necessary to maintain the morale of soldiers and a nation. Yet success is also required to reassure foreign capitals that support for Kyiv is not only desirable but still effective – that the arms and ammunition sent produce results on the ground.Ukraine’s leaders have been astonishingly successful in persuading other leaders to step up supplies, providing the kind of equipment ruled out as unthinkable only months before. But support is not infinite and Joe Biden is preparing to run against Donald Trump, who will not even say he wants Ukraine to win, for the presidency in 2024.All the conjecture about Kyiv’s plans and abilities can obscure perhaps the most important fact about this endeavour. What is often fogged, for those watching from afar, is not just what happens in each battle, with what effort and weaponry, to what military and political effect, but the human price. Those attacking usually suffer far more casualties than those defending. Even extraordinary success for Kyiv – whether in liberating territory or by engaging and destroying Russian formations – will cost the lives of large numbers of fighters, many of whom were teachers or farmers or engineers or artists until war was forced upon them.Civilians too will continue to pay. On Sunday, a two-year-old girl was killed in a Russian strike on Dnipro. The death of children is an increasingly familiar horror; another was unleashed on Tuesday with the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and power plant on the Dnipro River – forcing thousands to flee to safety as their homes and land were flooded in a human-made disaster that could have consequences for generations.Kyiv and Moscow blame each other for the attack. The immediate benefit is to Russia, in helping to fend off a Ukrainian advance. It has been relentless in targeting other parts of Ukraine’s power network. But the devastation also cuts off desperately needed water supplies to annexed Crimea. Experts say that there is no immediate risk to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant upstream, where reactors have already been shut down and the cooling lake on site should be sufficient for the next few months. But the recklessness shown towards the facility underlines the fear that there could be worse to come.For a country fighting off occupiers, the necessity of success is shadowed by its cost. Against an adversary such as Russia, which has shown itself ruthlessly indifferent to distinctions between the military and civilians in war, that will be especially the case.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-counteroffensive-even-success-has-a-cost"},
{"article_title": null, "author": null, "summary": "Four years after my husband’s death, the question of where to locate my grief still isn’t easy to answer", "date_of_pub": "Wed 7 Jun 2023", "content": "If you could drop a pin on the map of your grief, where would you travel to? In the early days of mine, I would have motioned you to the toilet in my bathroom where I heaved on my knees, again and again, into the bowl below. Six months later, I would have swapped that room’s lino flooring for grass, walking you down to the banks of the River Thames. We’d head to the bend in the water where I scattered my husband’s ashes in a boat, marvelling at the patterns he made, watching him spiral and swirl.These days, four years on from his death, the question of “where” to locate my grief isn’t an easy one to answer. There isn’t a cursor to follow, nor is there a grid reference to share. I suspect that this ambiguity, at least in part, reflects the intangible quality of the water in which I released his ashes. For many years, I pondered whether a headstone would have given me the sense of stability I so desperately craved. The regular pilgrimage to a rooted headstone can give a sense of direction and sanctuary to many people in their grief. A visible conduit between two disparate worlds. But, as time goes on, the distance between “then” and “now” widens – and with it, my own understanding of what transience and permanence actually mean.I often describe my grief as the air around me: not a coordinate to map, but a weather vane to gauge. Sometimes it’s a gentle breeze and other times (lesser now, as my life reconfigures) it’s been a billowing wind. On the days that it’s still, which are becoming more frequent, I wonder how much I’m forgetting.“I thought the other day I should visit,” the poet Michael Rosen said in an interview with the Observer, about the grave that marks the sudden death of his son in 1999. “I ought to. People say they go and see it,” he added, referring to his decision not to – in spite of all the societal expectations that might push a person to venture to a place too painful to visit. It was the “ought to” that got me thinking about the pressure we place on ourselves, and each other, in times of loss – whether we’re wholly aware of it or not. The “I should be doing this” or the “why aren’t I feeling that”. The anniversaries to mark each year, the totems to honour, the landmarks to visit.A line in Neil MacGregor’s Living with the Gods expresses a question I’ve often asked myself: “How do the living stay in touch with the dead?” However hard we might wish for it, there is no single answer to such a multitudinous inquiry when it comes to loss. On any given day my reply might be different. As mercurial as water – like my memories, too. There are currently more than 12,000 historic cemeteries, churchyards and burial grounds in England and Wales. A site of sanctuary and pilgrimage for so many. Yet reading Rosen’s words, I couldn’t help but picture the ones who might share in his hesitation – I’m one of them, after all. A normal – and wholly understandable – ellipsis that surely reflects the atemporal nature of grief itself: beyond the boundaries of any one tangible place that society might ascribe to it.If my experience of grief – and my reading of it, too – has taught me anything, it’s that it can be counterproductive to try to contain something so unquantifiable in its shape and form. Perhaps the only constant to be found in grief is its inconsistency. Many writers before me have likened the disorientation it generates to being geographically lost. In A Grief Observed, CS Lewis wrote of ever-repeating circles after the death of his wife, Joy Davidman: “For in grief nothing ‘stays put’. One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round.”Although she never wrote of her grief, I remember visiting the Brontë Parsonage museum on a frosty winter morning in 2016, where I read about Charlotte’s solitary laps around the dining table after the deaths of her siblings Emily and Anne. A few hours after I finished reading Rosen’s interview, I opened up my copy of Deborah Levy’s memoir, The Cost of Living, and found myself at a point of intersection: “Where are we now?” Levy wrote, sketching the weeks after her mother died. “Where were we before?”I doubt that there’s a griever out there who hasn’t asked themselves these two questions in the debris of their loss. But as the years go by, I am less inclined to believe that there is a pin on the map that may bring me close enough with my past to help me make sense of what it is to lose someone you love in any fulfilling way. It’s been nearly a year since I last walked that particular stretch of the River Thames, and it may well be another before I return. The desire to retrace my steps has become less urgent in me over the past 12 months. For in life, as in grief, Lewis was right – nothing “stays put”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/lost-loved-one-shrines-past-grief"},
{"article_title": "States haven’t stopped spying on their citizens, post-Snowden – they’ve just got sneakier", "author": "Heather Brooke", "summary": "The historic leaks prompted legislation: yet governments are finding new ways to monitor us. The UK’s online safety bill is one of them", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "It’s been 10 years since Edward Snowden holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room and exposed Britain and America’s mass surveillance operations to a group of journalists. His bombshell revelations revealed how the US and UK governments were spying on their citizens, intercepting, processing and storing their data, and sharing this information. Since then, although neither state has lost its appetite for hoovering up huge amounts of personal data, new transparency and oversight constraints, together with the growth of encrypted technology, have tilted the balance towards privacy.Snowden’s revelations sparked outrage and anger. Bulk interception was being done without a democratic mandate and with few real safeguards. When the scope of this surveillance came to light, officials claimed most of the information was not “read” and therefore its collection did not violate privacy. This was disingenuous; the data could reveal an intimate picture of someone’s life – a fact that was upheld in later legal challenges, which proved the surveillance violated privacy and human rights law.After the leaks, three reviews took place in the UK. The first was done by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). It did little to interrogate what the spies were actually up to, even while acknowledging that new legislation was required. A review by David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, was more circumspect and suggested a series of improvements. Finally, the Home Office convened a panel (of which I was a part, alongside an ex minister, former security chiefs and Martha Lane Fox) that produced a report and a series of recommendations.These three reports eventually led to the 2016 passage of the Investigatory Powers Act, which clarified what types of state surveillance were allowed and how these needed to be authorised. The act allowed bulk interception – much to the dismay of many privacy campaigners – but changed the process governing how this interception was authorised. This meant that while a secretary of state could sign off a warrant justifying the most intrusive powers, that warrant must also be approved by an independent judicial commissioner.The legacy of Snowden’s leaks is mixed. Bulk interception and surveillance hasn’t stopped, despite there now being greater transparency and more oversight. “There are a few more safeguards, but mostly it continues,” Caroline Wilson Palow, the legal director at Privacy International (PI), told me. The greatest legacy of Snowden’s leaks are the legal challenges they have made possible. Until these revelations, it was nearly impossible to bring a legal case challenging state surveillance. There have now been several successful lawsuits.Beginning in 2013, civil rights organisations, including PI, Liberty and Big Brother Watch, began challenging bulk interception and surveillance in the European court of human rights and English courts. The human rights court rulings set a precedent across Europe that such spying requires prior independent or judicial authorisation that must be meaningful, rigorous and check for proper “end-to-end safeguards”. Earlier this year, MI5 was found to have acted unlawfully by the investigatory powers tribunal in retaining huge amounts of personal data after a case was brought by PI and Liberty. None of these cases would have been possible if Snowden’s information hadn’t come to light, and hopefully they put pressure on the intelligence agencies to pay attention to the legal safeguards.As technology evolves, so too does surveillance. States have found new ways to spy on citizens, particularly using the mobile phones we all carry around. Intrusive spyware such as Pegasus, sold by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, can turn a person’s phone into a 24-hour surveillance machine. A 2021 investigation by the Guardian and other media organisations showed how activists, journalists and lawyers had been targeted by malware bought by countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary and India.Too often, security services conflate protection of those in power with protection of the public. Politicians have long used their security services and surveillance powers to stifle protest and dissent by targeting anyone who might legitimately challenge (or even question) their hold on power. This is why the interests of the security services so often come at the expense of the public. Even so, the rallying cry of protecting the public is often used to justify such invasive surveillance.We can see something similar happening with the UK’s online safety bill. Discussions about this have conflated the public’s legitimate concern about bad online behaviour with the security services’ agenda of breaking end-to-end encryption. Gaining a backdoor to encrypted chat has been on spies’ wishlist almost since the internet was invented. But there is no guarantee this will make the internet safer or free from harm.In its current form, the bill would effectively deputise spying activities to technology companies, which could scan users’ messages and social media posts for evidence of harms that they could then report to the authorities. Understandably, there’s huge demand for more accountability online, where bad and dangerous behaviour often goes unchecked. But the proposed bill will allow intelligence agencies to spy on ordinary citizens via technology platforms.The fact is, the majority of online abuse isn’t happening in secret. It’s in plain sight and still nothing is done about it. Bad behaviour online has few consequences. Women face rape and death threats simply for daring to speak out online. Any teenager can access radicalising messages from racists and misogynists or watch extreme pornography showing physically violent, hostile depictions of sex. They don’t need cryptography to view such things.This raises the elephant in the room around any discussion about online safety: the business model of big tech. It, too, relies on mass surveillance but of a different kind, where users’ behaviour is watched by machines in order to build algorithms, so that social media can serve up posts they think we’ll engage with. The monetisation of users’ attention has incentivised tech companies to create algorithms that tend toward extreme, radicalising content as that is the kind that draws the most engagement. Breaking encryption does nothing to solve this problem.Snowden’s leaks put paid to any doubt we live in a surveillance society. But thanks to the revelations, the security services themselves came under scrutiny and were found lacking. Mass surveillance was checked, if only through more accountability. Now we face another push by the state to spy on us under the guise of online safety. Let’s not be fooled that surveillance makes us safer. The reality is nothing puts us in more danger.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/edward-snowden-state-surveillance-uk-online-safety-bill"},
{"article_title": "The die is cast: petrol and diesel engines are dying. The electric age is inevitable", "author": "Ben Lane", "summary": "Arguments over the green credentials of electric cars are already over. Work on 21st-century tech, and leave the past behind", "date_of_pub": "Wed 7 Jun 2023", "content": "It should by now be clear to all vehicle manufacturers and policymakers that the electric vehicle (EV) age is all but inevitable. Most drivers already get it, as shown by the huge order books for most electric models. The long-running fight over whether electric or petrol/diesel engines generate more emissions during their lifecycle, further fuelled by Rowan Atkinson’s recent intervention, is in fact all but over. After years of crunching the numbers, peer-reviewed studies consistently arrive at the same conclusion: EVs win. The UK government’s own research supports this position and concludes that transitioning to zero-emission vehicles would “significantly” reduce overall carbon use.Of course, where the vehicle and battery are manufactured, and how the electricity is generated, make a difference to the carbon benefits of EVs. But helpful and accessible tools such as the Transport & Environment campaign’s How clean are electric cars? calculator are doing much to demystify these concerns for the average person. This tool clearly shows that across its whole lifetime, a small EV driven in Sweden using a battery produced there emits 83% less than a similar petrol car – that’s a huge improvement. Even one driven in Poland with a battery made in China still emits 37% less.As someone who has spent more than 20 years working in e-mobility, first in policy and then in the EV industry, I want to see us move beyond the basic emissions debate – which by any reasonable standard of proof is over. With EVs already numbering more than 20 million worldwide, and global EV sales surging every year, there’s so much more to discuss about EV technology that is of supreme importance to how we approach climate policy.First is the under-appreciated efficiency improvements offered by EVs. Since the start of the industrial revolution, the heat engine has been the core technology enabling the controlled release of the significant quantity of energy contained in fossil fuels. In the 300 years between the invention of the first steam engine and the kind of internal combustion engines (ICE) used by most vehicles today, thermal efficiencies – the amount of heat converted into work or motion – have dramatically improved, from less than 1% for the Newcomen engine (invented in the early 18th century and used to pump water out of deep mines) to around 40% for the Toyota Prius hybrid.However, since the French physicist Sadi Carnot first expounded the thermodynamic cycle in 1824, we have known that the maximum efficiency of any heat engine is limited by the upper and lower temperatures of an engine’s cycle. Carnot’s formula tells us that we have already reached this limit for petrol engines; any further investment only providing diminishing returns. The petrol engine is therefore doomed to waste at least half the energy carried in a car’s fuel tank.EVs, on the other hand, convert the electrochemical energy stored in the battery to motion using motors that have efficiencies of more than 85%, and even accounting for the losses of delivering energy to the charger, EVs remain more energy- and carbon-efficient than their fossil-fuel equivalents. And electrification gives us a clear path to the greater use of renewables as the grid continues to decarbonise. In an age when energy is a highly valued resource, and there is an urgent need to drastically cut carbon emissions, we must therefore be bold and ditch the heat engine as fast as possible.Second is the observation that the automotive industry is increasingly at odds with the other technology sectors, and closer to the age of steam than one based on modern materials and processes. While the digital revolution is transforming almost all human experiences, ICE-powered road transport continues to rely on largely mechanical systems that use steel components, with each vehicle having tens of thousands of moving parts, all of which must be designed, supplied and maintained. Furthermore, the vehicle’s energy is provided by complex, processed liquid fuels that are transported in bulk from halfway around the world. This makes it highly dependent on heavy engineering and the movement of large quantities of raw and processed materials.Contrast this with the possibilities offered by electrification – ones that are already materialising at scale. Vehicles that are high-quality, high-performance, zero-emission and quiet in their operation, with driving ranges of more than 300 miles, recharging times of less than 30 minutes and batteries that can be recycled. Vehicles that are relatively simple in their engineering design, constructed from lightweight materials such as carbon composites, and controlled by highly flexible software that can be updated over-the-air. Not only can EVs be charged using renewable energy, they can also provide mass storage for excess wind and solar energy at times of oversupply, and then support the grid by feeding back this energy at peak times, becoming a critical part of our future energy infrastructure.Yes, we need new battery chemistries to extend vehicle ranges at lower costs. Yes, we need more public charging infrastructure (the UK’s target is for 300,000 devices by 2030). Yes, we must be vigilant to ensure that the new environmental impacts of mining and battery production are well understood and highly regulated. And no, EVs on their own are not enough to solve the transport element of the climate crisis – we also need better public transport and more support for walking, cycling and new mobility services.But to press on with a 19th-century technology makes no sense in the digital age, which is decarbonising at pace. While completing the transition from internal combustion engine to EV will be challenging and will require imagination, innovation and investment, not doing so would be a grave mistake. It would cost not just carbon emissions and cleaner air, but also jobs and the UK’s place at the global automotive table.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/petrol-diesel-engines-technology-electric-cars"}
